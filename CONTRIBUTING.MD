# Contributing

- Try and complete something from TODO.md

- All contributions are completely welcome!

- Write clean code! Use semantically meaningful naming, add comments, and most of all, prioritize readability.

- Be nice, but don't hesitate to correct someone on an issue!

**_These are much less important!_** If you can't use these tools, don't worry about it.

- When writing code, please use the `Prettier` formatter. If for some reason you can't use the formatter, please do your best to format the code in a similar manner.

- When using imports, please use the `isort` formatter. Again, if you can't use the formatter, please do your best to format the code in a similar manner.
