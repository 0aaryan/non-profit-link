# TODO

- Apparently I have been misspelling "organization" as "orginization". This is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life. If you see a misspelled word, please change it.

- Add a modal on the dashboard that allows you to add and remove needed and wanted items (Currently working on this, but feel free to contribute)

- Create the frontend for items/search-items/

- Create the frontend for accounts/all-non-profits/

- Add an edit account URL

- Add logic to edit account URL
