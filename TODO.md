# TODO

- Mainly using a Kanban for my TODO at the moment, please reach out for more information. In general, I am designing the frontend according to the Figma design listed in the README.

# Login/Register/Logout forms

- Some frontend work could be useful here, but I mainly need to finish the backend

# Pass a JSON to homepage with most needy non-profits and most needed items

- Use context in the homepage route to pass it, or abstract it into its own route?
