`pre_optimized_item_api` is the inital Item API that I created. It was/is incredibly pre-optimized, which just made use of it more painful. I would love to do something with it in the future, but not right now.

## TODO List

- Apparently I have been misspelling "organization" as "orginization". This is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life. If you see a misspelled word, please change it.

- Update to Django 5.0. Test EVERYTHING before declaring the project as usable with Django 5.0

- Rewrite some of/finish the design docs for the Items API/modal

- General frontend work, like touching up the dashboard, adding shadows, etc.

- Create the frontend for items/search-items/

- Create the frontend for accounts/all-non-profits/

- Add an edit account URL

- Add logic to edit account URL
