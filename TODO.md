# TODO

A lot of smaller TODOs will be located with a "# TODO" in files. You can use extensions to easily locate these, or just find them manually.

# Branches

`pre_optimized_item_api` is the inital Item API that I created. It was/is incredibly pre-optimized, which just made use of it more painful. I would love to do something with it in the future, but not right now.

# TODO List

## Global

- Move all of these TODOs to GitHub issues

- Create the frontend for accounts/search-non-profits/

- Flesh out nonprofits/homepage/MYORGNAME/. Shouldn't take too much, there's not really any interactivity

- Scale UI design from mobile to all sizes

- Apparently I have been misspelling "organization" as "orginization". This is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life. If you see a misspelled word, please change it.

- Refactor static URLS to more "dynamic" URLs; for example, don't put "accounts/myurl" as a route, put "{% url 'myurl_name' %}.

## Dashboard

- There's a random semicolon on the "Edit Account Info" modal. I have no idea where it's coming from, but I need to fix it.

- Refactor. So much refactoring.

## Login

- Figure out a better way to place form errors. Right now it's kinda in the middle of everything.

## Index page

- Add links to button
