# TODO

A lot of smaller TODOs will be located with a "# TODO" in files. You can use extensions to easily locate these, or just find them manually.

# Branches

`pre_optimized_item_api` is the inital Item API that I created. It was/is incredibly pre-optimized, which just made use of it more painful. I would love to do something with it in the future, but not right now.

## TODO List

### Global

- Apparently I have been misspelling "organization" as "orginization". This is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life. If you see a misspelled word, please change it.

- More "dynamic" URLs and redirects? I'm not sure if this is a thing, and if it is, I don't know how to do it.

- Fix `Prettier` and `isort` import formatting conflicts

### Dashboard

- Figure out how to validate the OrgForm but ignore duplicates

- Figure out how to only validate the password if both the password and confirm_password field work

- Change the modal to only close if the form has no errors

- Styling, styling, styling! (Primarily `label`, `input`, and `textarea`)

### General stuff

- General frontend work, like touching up the dashboard, adding shadows, etc.

- Create the frontend for items/search-items/

- Create the frontend for accounts/all-non-profits/

- Add an edit account URL

- Add logic to edit account URL
