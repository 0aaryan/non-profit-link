# TODO

- Complete CSS on existing HTML in layout.html
- Move webpage text to JSON, or a database?

# Design database in Django

- Database schema
- Create an admin user
- Create a command to create a non-profit from terminal
- Update admin panel with org

# Login/Register/Logout forms

- Some frontend work could be useful here, but I mainly need to finish the backend

# Pass a JSON to homepage with most needy non-profits and most needed items

- Use context in the homepage route to pass it, or abstract it into its own route?
