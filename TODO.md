# TODO

A lot of smaller TODOs will be located with a "# TODO" in files. You can use extensions to easily locate these, or just find them manually.

# Branches

`pre_optimized_item_api` is the inital Item API that I created. It was/is incredibly pre-optimized, which just made use of it more painful. I would love to do something with it in the future, but not right now.

# TODO List

## Global

- Change incredibly confusing names (homepage.css and homepage.html are not the same thing)

- Create the frontend for items/search-items/

- Create the frontend for accounts/all-non-profits/

- Flesh out nonprofits/homepage/MYORGNAME/. Shouldn't take too much, there's not really any interactivity

- Scale UI design from mobile to all sizes

- Apparently I have been misspelling "organization" as "orginization". This is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life. If you see a misspelled word, please change it.

- Refactor static URLS to more "dynamic" URLs; for example, don't put "accounts/myurl" as a route, put "{% url 'myurl_name' %}.

## Dashboard

- There's a random semicolon on the "Edit Account Info" modal. I have no idea where it's coming from, but I need to fix it.

- Refactor. So much refactoring.

FOR FRONTEND WORK: Here's the [Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/file/pKaku2N7xVPbCGQb1p6LIJ/NPL?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=mc7YWpRIbtvPRkHG-11) to work off of. Make sure to design mobile first!
