# TODO

- Apparently I have been misspelling "organization" as "orginization". This is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life. If you see a misspelled word, please change it.

- Finish the frontend on the homepage.

- Finish the frontend on the dashboard

- Add an edit account URL (and of course the logic behind editing an accounts information)

- On the dashboard, add some sort of pop up that, when pressing the "edit needed items" or "edit wanted items" button, allows you to add and remove those items.

- Add a URL (see Contributable Items in the navbar) that contains a list of contributable items.

- Add a URL (see Non-profits in the navbar) that shows a list of _all_ the non-profits

FOR FRONTEND WORK: Here's a [Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/file/pKaku2N7xVPbCGQb1p6LIJ/NPL?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=mc7YWpRIbtvPRkHG-11) to work off of. Make sure to design mobile first!
