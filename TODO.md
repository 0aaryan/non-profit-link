# TODO

- Apparently I have been misspelling "organization" as "orginization". This is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life. If you see a misspelled word, please change it.

- Add functionality to both of the modals on the dashboard

- Create the frontend for items/search-items/

- Create the frontend for accounts/all-non-profits/

- Add an edit account URL

- Add logic to edit account URL

- Figure out why Django randomly doesn't get static files (but the page still functions as intended). Ex:

```
[06/Dec/2023 20:11:04] "GET /nonprofits/dashboard/ HTTP/1.1" 200 2954
[06/Dec/2023 20:11:05] "GET /nonprofits/dashboard/ HTTP/1.1" 200 2954
Not Found: /nonprofits/dashboard/dashboard.js
[06/Dec/2023 20:11:05] "GET /nonprofits/dashboard/dashboard.js HTTP/1.1" 404 3270
```

FOR FRONTEND WORK: Here's the [Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/file/pKaku2N7xVPbCGQb1p6LIJ/NPL?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=mc7YWpRIbtvPRkHG-11) to work off of. Make sure to design mobile first!
