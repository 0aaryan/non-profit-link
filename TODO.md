cod# TODO

A lot of smaller TODOs will be located with a "# TODO" in files. You can use extensions to easily locate these, or just find them manually.

# Branches

`pre_optimized_item_api` is the inital Item API that I created. It was/is incredibly pre-optimized, which just made use of it more painful. I would love to do something with it in the future, but not right now.

## TODO List

### Global

- Apparently I have been misspelling "organization" as "orginization". This is the most embarrassing moment of my entire life. If you see a misspelled word, please change it.

### Dashboard

- Add "edit information" logic to the edit information button on the dashboard

- Styling, styling, styling!

### General stuff

- General frontend work, like touching up the dashboard, adding shadows, etc.

- Create the frontend for items/search-items/

- Create the frontend for accounts/all-non-profits/

- Add an edit account URL

- Add logic to edit account URL
