# Important info
__**I'm planning to migrate this entire project to Django soon!**__ 

Thus, any flask based things (like adding user interactions through the flash function) should be postponed!

I've never collaborated on github before, so my settings could be completely screwed up. If they are, please let me know.

# How can I contribute?
You could check out the [how can I help?](), or if you're interested in contributing for the long(er) term, check out [Todoist](#todo), 

# How can I help?
If you're interested in contributing, please do! I will take all the help I can get, but here's what I'm really confused on/really need right now:

-Frontend: (as in CSS, and styling). I'm completely lost on this stuff.

-Documentation: I probably make enough comments myself for readability, but the README feels really light. 

-Diagrams: There are a bunch of unfinished diagrams in draw.io, and some help would be awesome! They're pretty self explanatory, but please feel free to contact me if it's not clear.

-Names/ideas: I need names for the project itself, and ideas for what I should do with this.

-Database design: I have a decent grasp on this, but getting keys/normalization right is tricky for me

__**When the Django migragtion is finished:**__

Different types of accounts: Admin account, and business/non profit account

User interaction: This would've been done through Flask Flashes, so use whatever is the equivalent with Django

Rework diagrams: I'm sure everything in Django will be a little bit different, so there might be a little bit of rewriting for everything, inculding diagrams.

# TODO
I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/app/today) to mange all of my tasks. You need an account, and *I* need to invite you to the project. 

Just send me the email that you registered with to any of my listed contacts
