# NPL (Non Profit Link)
Written in Python, Jinja2, HTML, CSS, and SQLite3

Layout/Design: Read this if you're trying to understand the project: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1nvq48tW1w0B1AnsZFVPUc0GktWn2xSzwuHfUjbxIF3M/edit?usp=sharing. However, everything will ***eventually be on .drawio files***.

Database design: Keep in mind that this platform doesn't support SQLITE flavors, so production code will look a teensy bit different. Database currently meets: Third Normal Form (3NF); (This may be deprecated, I'll likely forget about it). https://drawsql.app/teams/da-best-team-in-da-world/diagrams/main

# FAQ
#### What am I going to do with this?
I will do my best to explain this, but no promises that it'll make sense. My mom frequently volunteers for local organizations such as food pantries and homeless shelters. Despite the assumption that these organizations always require more supplies, that is fairly often incorrect. In my own experience, I have observed that they often have an excess of some items but a shortage of others. The simple solution to this is just to share, but if there's not a platform to share/advertise these supplies on, that creates a problem since there's normally no communication between them, thus hindering them from sharing resources. To resolve this, I'd like to develop a web application with Flask that will enable these establishments to list what they have and what they need. There are a few other things that I want to do with this that I'll make note of over time, but for now, that's the main goal.

#### What database will you/are you using?
SQLite, I'm lazy. I do of course have a database file, but I'm adding it to .gitignore. There might be multiple db files at somepoint.

#### Why are there so many "Lorem ipsums"?
I just want to simulate having to scroll down a page, just to make sure everything scrolls properly. The actual text here probably won't be longer than a paragraph.
