Written in Python, HTML, and CSS (hopefully SQL once I get the database stuff figured out)

### What am I going to do with this?
I have some pre-mature ideas, but whatever I end up doing with it, I want it to be decently sophsticated. Stuff like movable maps, login/password stuff, and utilizing data structures to make that stuff easier.

Side note to myself: I have wtforms and flask_wtf in requirements.txt, even though I'm not technically using them at the time of this commit.
