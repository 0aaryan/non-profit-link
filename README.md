# Flask Web App
Written in Python, HTML, and CSS (hopefully SQL once I get the database stuff figured out)

# FAQ
### What am I going to do with this?
I have some pre-mature ideas, but whatever I end up doing with it, I want it to be decently sophsticated. Stuff like movable maps, login/password stuff, and utilizing data structures to make that stuff easier.

### What database will you/are you using?
SQLite, I'm lazy. I do have a database file, but I'm adding it to .gitignore.

side note to myself: i don't know sql lmao

Side note to myself: I have wtforms and flask_wtf in requirements.txt, even though I'm not technically using them at the time of this commit.
