### What am I going to do with this?
This is hard to explain through text, but I'll do my best. My mother often volunteers for local organizations such as food pantries and homeless shelters. I know what you're thinking; I should make something that allows these organizations to have access to more supplies, because they're so low on them. It's quite the opposite, actually. In my experience (which is only 2 or 3 places, to be fair), they tend to have too much of one thing, and barely enough of the other. This in itself is a problem, but the bigger problem is that there are no lines of communication between them, so even if they want to share, they really can't. I want to make a webapp that allows these organizations to list what they have to give, and what they need. I'd also like to add an option for businesses to display what they have. I'm not quite sure yet though.

### What database will you/are you using?
SQLite, I'm lazy. I do have a database file, but I'm adding it to .gitignore. There will be multiple database files at somepoint, just fyi.

### Why is there so many "Lorem ipsums"?
I just want to simulate having to scroll down a page, just to make sure everything scrolls properly. The actual text here probably won't be longer than a paragraph.
