# FAQ

## So... React?

React has (as of 11/30/23) been completely removed from this project. I would've liked to have kept it around, but it was really only causing _major_ cramps in my workflow. Other than being "scalable", it served no purpose.

## What am I going to do with this/what is it for?

I will do my best to explain this, but no promises that it'll make sense. My mom frequently volunteers for local organizations such as food pantries and homeless shelters. These organizations might seem like they're always in need of every single supply, but that's not quite correct. In my own experience, I have observed that they often have an excess of some items but a shortage of others. The simple solution to this is just to share, but if there's not a platform to share/advertise these supplies on, that creates a problem since there's no communication between them, thus hindering them from sharing resources.

To resolve this, I'd like to develop a web application with Django that will enable these organizations to list what they have and what they need. There are a few other things that I want to do with this that I'll make note of over time, but for now, that's the main goal.

## What database will you/are you using?

PostgreSQL (pronounced "post - gree - skew - l")
