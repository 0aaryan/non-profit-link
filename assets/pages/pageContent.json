        "paragraphContent": "The main idea of NPL is it, to help connect different charity organizations like food pantries or homeless shelters for example. These organizations often have excess of some supplies but might have a shortage of other supplies. This is where NPL comes into play; it provides a platform for these organizations where they can share their excess in return of supplies the really need. This could help reducing the waste of supplies and distributing it more optimal."
